#IDEs include a feature called syntax highlighting which shows different types of code in different colors

#creating a variable named message that will hold a string
message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)

#you can change the value of variables at any time
message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
print(message:="Hello Python Crash Course world!")
#Python keeps track of current value

#variable names
#   *can contian only letters, numbers, and underscores, can't begin with a number
#   *spaces aren't allowed, but underscores used to separate words in variable names
#   *avoid using Python keywords (print, socket...etc)
#   *use short but descriptive words 
#   *be careful with characters (l, O) because they look similar to (1, 0)
#   *should use lowercase letters, uppercase letters have special meanings
#   *can disregard spelling syntax for English, Python doesn't differentiate
#   *variables are labels you can assign to values, also variables reference values
