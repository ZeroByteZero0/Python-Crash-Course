#NUMBERS

#INTEGERS
#able to add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python
#able to floor divide (//) returns result without remainder
#use modulus (%) operator to return only the remainder
print(2 + 3)
print(3 -2)
print(2 * 3)
print(3/3)
print(3%2)
print(51//2)

#when using python terminal, you can enter a mathematical operation and the result will be returned
# >>> 2 + 3
# 5



#python also follows order of operations, which may be altered by use of parentheses ()
# >>> 2 + 4**2
# 18
# >>> (2 + 4)**2
# 26

#FLOATS
#   *Python calls any number with a decimal a float (the decimal is floating in the number...)
#   *you can do any operation on these floats, but sometimes results vary in decimal places
#   *this is controllable, you can change the amount of decimal points for a number to show


#INTEGERS AND FLOATS
#   *doing any division (/) on a whole number always returns a float
#   *mixing a float and an integer results in a float


#INTEGERS AND UNDERSCORES
#   *Python treats integer values with underscores the same as those without
#   *20_000 is the same as 20000 to Python, this is the same for floats as well

#MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS
#   *Python allows for multiple variable assignments to values in a single line of code
#   *separate variable names and values with commas
x,y,z = 0,0,0
print(x,y,z)

#CONSTANTS
#   *constants are variables whose values stay the same throughout the lifetime of a program
#   *Python doesn't keep track of constants
#   *a good way to differentiate from constants and regular variables is by naming with all capitals
MAX_VALUE = 1000

#COMMENTS
#   *(#) indicates comments in Python, anything following a (#) will be ignored by Py interpreter
#   *It's a good idea to comment on larger programs and lines of code to explain functionality
#   *"Writing clear, concise comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as a new programmer"

#THE ZEN OF PYTHON
#   The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
#   Beautiful is better than ugly.
#   Explicit is better than implicit.
#   Simple is better than complex.
#   Complex is better than complicated.
#   Flat is better than nested.
#   Sparse is better than dense.
#   Readability counts.
#   Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
#   Although practicality beats purity.
#   Errors should never pass silently.
#   Unless explicitly silenced.
#   In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
#   There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
#   Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
#   Now is better than never.
#   Although never is often better than *right* now.
#   If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
#   If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
#   Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
