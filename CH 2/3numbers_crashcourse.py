#NUMBERS

#INTEGERS
#able to add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python
#able to floor divide (//) returns result without remainder
#use modulus (%) operator to return only the remainder
print(2 + 3)
print(3 -2)
print(2 * 3)
print(3/3)
print(3%2)
print(51//2)

#when using python terminal, you can enter a mathematical operation and the result will be returned
# >>> 2 + 3
# 5



#python also follows order of operations, which may be altered by use of parentheses ()
# >>> 2 + 4**2
# 18
# >>> (2 + 4)**2
# 26

#FLOATS
#   *Python calls any number with a decimal a float (the decimal is floating in the number...)
#   *you can do any operation on these floats, but sometimes results vary in decimal places
#   *this is controllable, you can change the amount of decimal points for a number to show


#INTEGERS AND FLOATS
#   *doing any division (/) on a whole number always returns a float
#   *mixing a float and an integer results in a float


#INTEGERS AND UNDERSCORES
#   *Python treats integer values with underscores the same as those without
#   *20_000 is the same as 20000 to Python
